## Summery

**Homework** 

In this work we analyze a dataset of San Fransisco Neighborhoods Housing data from 2010 to 2016. Our purpose is to help with investment decisions for rental income. We use various techniques and plots to show the data to audience, so that one can get meaningful insight of this market.

## Files

Our dataset have 2 files:

* [`neighbourhoods_coordinates` CSV File](Resources/neighbourhoods_coordinates.csv)

Contains neighborhoods' longitude and latitude cordination

* [`sfo_neighbourhoods_census_data` CSV File](Resources/sfo_neighbourhoods_census_data.csv)

Contains year 2010-2016, neighborhood, sale-price-per-square-foot, gross-rental, and unit numbers

## Data Insights

In this work we speculate with the following revealations from our data:

- City total housing units from 2010 to 2016, from which one can see that not many units were added year by year
- The city average Rental Gross and Sale Price (per square foot) from 2010 to 2016 for some idea of trend, from which one can see that the rental gross increases faster than sale price
- Neighborhoods average Rental Gross and Sale Price from 2010 to 2016, from which one finds some neighborhoods' rental increased more rapidly than others
- Neighborhoods on map showing Rental Gross in color shades and Sale Prices in circle sizes, from which one can more easily identify neighborhoods worthy investing
- Neighborhoods rent-to-sale ratio from 2010 to 2016, from which one can pick the higher return on investment incorporating the trend as one factor of assessment

## Conclusion

San Fransisco from 2010 to 2016 have not many housing units added, while the rental went sky rocketing. By 2016, the sale prices have not yet caught up with the rental. Hence it was a exciting investment opportunity. 

Having made up mind, one should look more closely to where in the city to buy. Our neighborhood insights thus come to help.
